The menthol and eucalyptus scent also provides a light, invigorating aroma that will help uplift you.

How does it work? The sleek tool has stainless mesh to capture sand and other sediments; calcium sulfite to remove chlorine; KDF 55 to target minerals and residual chlorine; granular activated carbon to remove bacteria, mould and odours; finally, ceramic beads help to balance your shower water's pH level.

What's more, by lowering skin's pH (from 5.5 to around 3), this overnight treatment stimulates cellular activity — accelerating the repair and renewal processes, as skin works hard to re-establish equilibrium. It bolsters synthesis of elastin and collagen (the 'scaffolding' that keeps skin firm), while penetrating deep within pores to eradicate spot-causing bacteria, all while the resurfacing action helps to diminish visibility of post-blemish scars, dark spots and brown patches, so your complexion quickly looks more even-toned and luminous. It's a must-have for anyone concerned with premature skin ageing, sun damage or problem skin conditions — just build up skin's tolerance gradually (to minimise redness). Apply with a dampened cotton pad, once a week for 2–3 weeks while skin acclimatises, then build up to 3 'neat' applications a week for maximum skin-brightening benefit.","how_to_use":"Apply to cleansed skin every other night. Moisten the cotton pad with solution and apply evenly over the face, neck and decollete, avoiding your eye and lip area.

If your skin is sensitive to pressure, the Body Brush Soft is a gentle, delicate option with a softer density to the Body Brush Medium. Perfect for dry brushing on dry skin, simply work in a clockwise direction - lightly brushing up and towards your heart to improve skin texture, tone and tightness as well as aiding blood circulation and metabolism while diminishing the look of cellulite and dispelling toxins. This can be used everywhere from your feet, legs and arms to your bum and stomach. It’s important to brush from the extremities - ie. your hands and feet - up towards the heart. On the stomach, work from the bottom right side of the abdomen/hip up to the ribs, horizontally across to the left and then down to the left hip and horizontally across to the right rib. Trust us, after experiencing this mindful task alongside its inevitable glow-giving results, you'll wonder why you didn't start sooner...","how_to_use":"Basically, you start at the extremities (furthest away from the heart) and massage towards the body centre (to the heart). Brush lightly with slow and even strokes towards the heart. Start with the front and back of the right foot and work your way towards the lower thigh. Brush from the lower leg to the thigh and then brush on to the right buttock. Then swipe the left side (from the foot to the lower leg and to thigh and buttock) in the same way. Copy this approach for the arms: brush starting with the right hand to the forearm, then from the lower to the upper arm. Then stroke from the left hand up to the left upper arm. When it comes to the stomach, it is important to follow the course of the colon to rule out any blockage. For this, you start on the bottom right side of the abdomen and brush upwards in small strokes until you approach the ribs. From there, brush horizontally to the left and continue down from there. It is important to brush clockwise.","ingredient":"","brand":"Dr. Barbara Sturm","volume":"","mark":0,"image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/13310114-1594896407604324.jpg"},

Because mineral SPF acts as a barrier, sitting on the surface of the skin, do smooth it on—don’t rub it in the way you would a moisturizer. Use a light touch with this and any products you apply after to avoid makeup pilling. WHERE: Face and neck. Bonus points for hands—after your eyes, hands are the number two spot that gives away age. WHEN: AM (every AM), after your moisturizer has fully absorbed into your skin. If wearing makeup, allow 2-3 minutes for the sunscreen to sink in before applying primer or other cosmetics. Reapply every 2 hours when in direct sunlight or getting wet. GOOD TO KNOW: Even though mineral sunscreen goes to work right away, we recommend following the FDA guidelines to wait 15 minutes before sun exposure. And remember: No sunscreen is a replacement for staying out of the sun. Use before the expiration date printed on the crimp on the tube.","ingredient":"Active Purpose Zinc oxide, 15.2% Sunscreen inactive Water/Aqua/Eau, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Diheptyl Succinate, C18-21 Alkane, Erythritol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Propanediol, Arachidyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, Coco-Glucoside, Ethyl Ferulate, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Bisabolol, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Gluconate, Xanthan Gum, Octyldodecyl Oleate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Sodium Hyaluronate, Crithmum Maritimum Extract , Maltodextrin, Moringa Oleifera Seed Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf, Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492).","brand":"Versed","volume":"50ml","mark":0,"image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/13191012-1624883950579227.jpg"},

In fact, the scrub helps to soothe irritation courtesy of hydrating cold-pressed macadamia oil and ethically-sourced beeswax, which leave your lips moisturised long after you’ve washed the scrub away. The Lip Balm is brimming with lanolin, a moisture-imparter that combats dryness and acts as a protective barrier against crack-inducers (cold weather, we’re looking at you). Coconut, grapeseed and olive oils also lend an intense dose of nourishment, while vitamin E soothes irritation. Bringing up the rear is coffee arabica seed oil to help improve blood flow and collagen production for a naturally plumper pout. This is a dream duo…","how_to_use":"Lip Scrub: whenever lips are feeling dry, apply the scrub and massage in circular motions, before wiping or brushing away.

The makers have cleverly combined Eastern wisdom with Scandinavian modernity to create a funky-looking acupressure mat that alleviates tension, stress and stubborn twinges - helping you to unwind, clear your mind and to feel more nimble. More than 8,800 non-toxic plastic spikes are arranged on the mat and work in a similar way to acupuncture needles, helping release endorphins (the body's own 'happiness' drug) and oyxtocin, to help you stay calm and relaxed.","how_to_use":"Lay the Bed of Nails on the floor or on a mattress and slowly lower yourself onto it. Beginners should wear a light T-shirt or lay a sheet over the mat until your body and skin get used to the spikes. Initially lie on the Bed of Nails for 10 - 15 mins, and as you get used to the pressure you can build up to 20 - 30 mins. Use as often as you need - preferably daily. Don't be alarmed if your skin stings a bit or feels warm and tingly, and it's perfectly safe to fall asleep for a while on the mat. Leaning against it (rather than laying on top of the mat and pillow) is a lighter way to use Bed of Nails while you acclimatise (you put less weight on the spikes when you do). Place the mat/pillow at the back of your sofa, bed or armchair to experience the benefits while building up your tolerance.","ingredient":"The nails are made of 100% recycled non-toxic ABS plastic, the textile is cotton.

Let us introduce you to theirvagina-friendly, Organic Cotton Tampons. Did you know that the majority of tampons are made out of synthetic materials and fibres which can cause vaginal discomfort? On top of that, these fibres can shed inside of the vagina and cause additional irritation.Studies also show that 15% of womens OB/GYN visits are due to irritation caused by menstruation care products, as most conventional tampons on the market are made from synthetic rayon fibres.DeoDocs 100% Organic Cotton Tampons are made without viscose/rayon and non-chlorine bleached cotton, are unscented, FDA-approved and clinically tested to be non-irritating and hypoallergenic. They've even added a special outer layer (also 100% cotton) to prevent shedding and fibre residues from remaining inside of the body once the tampon is removed.But it doesn't stop there, they're also made from 100% biodegradable materials (with a card board applicator) and are 100% vegan.","how_to_use":"Each box contains 16 tampons with cardboard applicators. Wash your hands and get into a comfortable position. You can squat, put one leg up, or sit on the toilet with your knees apart. Push the tampon into your vagina using the applicator or your finger. Inserting a tampon in your vagina is more comfortable if youre relaxed. Throw the wrapper and applicator in the bin dont flush them. Its best to change your tampon every 4-8 hours. Dont leave your tampon in for more than 8 hours. You can wear a tampon overnight, but put it in right before bed and change it as soon as you get up in the morning. You take the tampon out by gently pulling the string.

Perfect for layering under your favourite fragrance to increase the intensity (and extend its longevity). As intoxicating as its name suggests, Frédéric Malle’s Carnal Flower blooms from delicate beginnings to a dark, seductive heart. Shy to begin with, this multi-faceted fragrance is an ode to awakening – evolving from the bashful notes of water fruits (melon) and citrus leaves which lend a verdant freshness, to the heady thrum of tuberose that gives this scent its sensuous appeal. An emblem of forbidden pleasure, this tantalising flower has a depth and mystery that is forbidden to young women in some cultures – believed to have the power to intoxicate the senses. With coconut to add a subtle lightness, and camphora to quieten the ‘noise’ of these opulent blooms, the muse for the fragrance was Frédéric’s aunt (the famous French actress Candice Bergen), who played in the film Carnal Knowledge alongside Jack Nicholson.

(That’s a lot of worry-free adventure time for your little ones!) Exceptionally water-resistant and free of parabens, nanoparticles and perfumes, this formula is ideal for sensitive and delicate young skin. With a quick drying-time and invisible, matte finish, this hydrating mousse actually forms an innovative protective barrier that mimics skin’s natural defences – providing extraordinary protection without clogging pores or sitting on the surface of your skin. Gentle, hypoallergenic, suitable for use from just six months old and totally smudge-proof (even when up against towel rub-downs post swim!) the Sunscreen Mousse SPF30 Kids lasts twice as long as cream formulas and helps to prevent future skin damage. Now you just need a holiday to go with it…","how_to_use":"For children younger than 16 years, EVY Technology always recommends SPF 30 or higher. Even children with darker skin should be protected with high UVA protection, because children’s skin is thinner. Reapplication: Thanks to the patented skincare technology, EVY is absorbed into the entire epidermis, rather than sitting on the skin's surface. This results in a much longer-lasting protection. However, in line with regulations, EVY do advise you to reapply frequently, especially as it's easy to miss a spot during the first time around. Recycling: Simply break off the plastic top for plastic recycling and place the aluminium bottle in the metal recycling bin.","ingredient":"Aqua, Butane, Propylene Glycol, Octocrylene, Palmitic Acid, Isobutane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, PVP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, PVP, Triethanolamine, Polysorbate 20, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Propane, Tocopherol.","brand":"EVY Technology","volume":"","mark":0,"image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/13310481-1304896413543259.jpg"},

Plenty of factors can weaken the pelvic floor muscles, including pregnancy, childbirth, ageing and high-impact sport, to the point that 1 in 3 women experience issues with them - and up to 80% of expectant mums. Designed to strengthen these muscles, the trainer can help to improve bladder control and sex, as well as preparing for childbirth and speeding up postnatal recovery. How does it work? The bulb of the tracker features force and motion sensors to measure the movement of your muscles as they contract and release. This is inserted into the vagina with the tail remaining outside and facing forwards (a little like a tampon), then via Bluetooth it connects to an app on your phone that will guide you through a series of five-minute workouts - from target hitting to strength exercises. There are four different levels to try - Training, Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced - all of which have been carefully designed with the help of physiotherapists and experts. The app also allows you to track your progress, set yourself targets and schedule reminders - plus it's fun, so it'll help you to stay motivated! Incredibly discreet, the device comes in a sleek carry case that doubles up as a charger so you can pop it in your on-the-go bag for use anytime, anywhere. 100% waterproof, the trainer is made with medical grade silicone making it incredibly durable and safe.","how_to_use":"Elvie Trainer is easy to insert: place the bulb inside like a tampon with the tail remaining outside, facing forward. Be sure to fully insert the bulb, but don't push it too high up. You can use water-based lubricant if you wish. We recommend you use the trainer either standing or lying, legs apart. If you find Elvie Trainer is slipping out or moving about inside, please try using Elvie Trainer with the optional cover. We recommend all women use Elvie Trainer both with and without at first to decide which provides the most comfortable fit for them. Also try changing position - if Elvie Trainer is slipping out, you might want to try lying for a workout, and see if you notice a difference. As with all exercise we encourage women to set realistic goals, so we recommend using Elvie Trainer three times a week as a minimum. However, if you want to use Elvie Trainer even more then that's even better! Made from a very hygienic and durable material, it can be cleaned using warm soapy water. During normal use it will only need charging about once a month and can be stored in the portable carry case between uses. You can use Elvie during pregnancy as long as you are not experiencing from any complications. Every pregnancy is unique so if you are unsure please consult your qualified medical professional before use. You can use Elvie Trainer after your qualified medical professional has advised that you are ready to resume to normal activities at your postpartum checkup, this is usually around 6 weeks after giving birth. Elvie Trainer is safe to use if you have a coil or IUD fitted.","ingredient":"Medical Grade Silicone","brand":"Elvie","volume":"","mark":0,"image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/11513404-8924871771176260.jpg"},

With a quick drying-time and invisible, matte finish, this hydrating mousse actually forms an innovative protective barrier that mimics skin’s natural defences – providing extraordinary protection without clogging pores or sitting on the surface of your skin.

Avoiding the use of nanoparticles (these are small enough to penetrate your skin and get inside your body), The Ordinary has formulated this sunscreen with ultra-refined zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, suspended within non-comedogenic (non-pore-blocking) silicones. This allows the formula to remain extremely lightweight and prevent it from over-burdening your skin. An advanced antioxidant complex scavenges and neutralises free radicals, minimizes the intensity of UV radiation penetrating the skin, while a bio-sugar complex provides both short and long-term hydration and also naturally increases skin’s own capacity to hold water. Finally, Tasmanian pepperberry helps to calm stressed skin for a soothed finish.","how_to_use":"Apply to face liberally and evenly 15 to 20 minutes before UV exposure.

If your skin isn't sensitive to pressure, the Body Brush Medium is a gentle but powerful option with a higher density than the Body Brush Soft. Perfect for dry brushing on dry skin, simply work in a clockwise direction - lightly brushing up and towards your heart to improve skin texture, tone and tightness as well as aiding blood circulation and metabolism while diminishing the look of cellulite and dispelling toxins. This can be used everywhere from your feet, legs and arms to your bum and stomach. It’s important to brush from the extremities - ie. your hands and feet - up towards the heart. On the stomach, work from the bottom right side of the abdomen/hip up to the ribs, horizontally across to the left and then down to the left hip and horizontally across to the right rib. Trust us, after experiencing this mindful task alongside its inevitable glow-giving results, you'll wonder why you didn't start sooner...","how_to_use":"Basically, you start at the extremities (furthest away from the heart) and massage towards the body centre (to the heart). Brush lightly with slow and even strokes towards the heart. Start with the front and back of the right foot and work your way towards the lower thigh. Brush from the lower leg to the thigh and then brush on to the right buttock. Then swipe the left side (from the foot to the lower leg and to thigh and buttock) in the same way. Copy this approach for the arms: brush starting with the right hand to the forearm, then from the lower to the upper arm. Then stroke from the left hand up to the left upper arm. When it comes to the stomach, it is important to follow the course of the colon to rule out any blockage. For this, you start on the bottom right side of the abdomen and brush upwards in small strokes until you approach the ribs. From there, brush horizontally to the left and continue down from there. It is important to brush clockwise. We recommend dry brushing 2-3 times per week.","ingredient":"","brand":"Dr. Barbara Sturm","volume":"","mark":0,"image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/13310115-8464896407648208.jpg"},

Nothing she tried had lived up to its promises, which is why she set about developing an exfoliating treatment and skin-smoothing body lotion, to gently resurface and intensively condition.
