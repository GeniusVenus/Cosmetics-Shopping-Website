The powder can be mixed with other treatments (except those containing niacinamide or EUK 134) so it will slot in perfectly to any ritual. With this format, a very strong tingling but non-irritating sensation is to be expected during the first 1-2 weeks of use while your skin’s tolerance to vitamin C is elevated.","how_to_use":"Mix a small amount with other treatments in the palm of your hand and apply to face in the AM or the PM. A tingling sensation can be expected after application. Do not mix with formulations containing Niacinamide or EUK 134. If topical Vitamin C is used as part of skin care, it should be applied at alternate times with EUK 134 or Niacinamide (ideally Vitamin C in the PM and EUK 134/Niacinamide in the AM). Otherwise, EUK 134/Niacinamide can affect the integrity of pure-form Vitamin C (L-Ascorbic Acid).","ingredient":"Ascorbic Acid","brand":"The Ordinary","volume":"20g","image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/11751838-7504901837696619.jpg","num":999,"profit":4.543318779214694,"num_sell":0},

Perfect for kick-starting the exfoliation process, the mitt allows subsequent products to work more effectively and helps to unblock hair follicles to minimise pesky, uncomfortable ingrown hairs. It’s also brilliant for treating Keratosis Pilaris – a remarkably common condition which causes skin to appear rough, red and bumpy due to an excess production of keratin, which results in the development of little ‘plugs’ or goose bumps.

{"productId":"Body_94","category":"Body","name":"BeYou Monthly Period Patches (5 Pack)","cost":"£7.99","description":"An incredibly intelligent plaster to help ease your period pain and cramps, these BeYou Monthly Patches are 100% natural and made from steam-distilled eucalyptus and peppermint-derived menthol that create a 'cooling tingle' on application. Long-lasting and slow-releasing, each patch slowly delivers a cramp-numbing sensation to skin over 12 hours. The menthol and eucalyptus scent also provides a light, invigorating aroma that will help uplift you. Simply apply to the area of concern, day or night, you can apply them to your back, abdomen and even to your legs (it can take up to 30 minutes for them to start working) and then get dressed and carry on with your day. Incredibly discreet, easy to apply and remove (they don't hurt like normal plasters!), you'll wonder how you ever went without these before - watch out trusty hot water bottle, BeYou Patches are coming for your title. Finally, they're also vegan, cruelty-free and biodegradable too! What's not to love?","how_to_use":"Step 1: Peel off the protective liner from the cuts in the middle. If you can, try not to touch the sticky back of the patch as it may reduce how effectively it sticks to your skin. Step 2: Place the patch uniformly over the area you want the cooling effect. You can apply your patch wherever makes you feel comfortable. Pro Tip: It can take 20-30mins before you start feeling the cooling sensation. Step 3: After using, peel the patch off slowly and throw in the bin! If you're worried about hair, just use some warm water to help! We always advise taking the patch off in the shower, once it has been wet and the adhesive has loosened up a little.","ingredient":"Mentha x piperata (Menthol Oil), Eucalyptus globulus (Eucalyptus Oil), Tracaganth Gum Rosin Ester, Guar Gum Rosin Ester, Mineral Oil","brand":"BeYou","volume":"Patches: x5","image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/12949009-2534850000296563.jpg","num":999,"profit":4.000191650946145,"num_sell":0},

What's more, by lowering skin's pH (from 5.5 to around 3), this overnight treatment stimulates cellular activity — accelerating the repair and renewal processes, as skin works hard to re-establish equilibrium. It bolsters synthesis of elastin and collagen (the 'scaffolding' that keeps skin firm), while penetrating deep within pores to eradicate spot-causing bacteria, all while the resurfacing action helps to diminish visibility of post-blemish scars, dark spots and brown patches, so your complexion quickly looks more even-toned and luminous. It's a must-have for anyone concerned with premature skin ageing, sun damage or problem skin conditions — just build up skin's tolerance gradually (to minimise redness). Apply with a dampened cotton pad, once a week for 2–3 weeks while skin acclimatises, then build up to 3 'neat' applications a week for maximum skin-brightening benefit.","how_to_use":"Apply to cleansed skin every other night.

Replenishing as it resurfaces, this clever formula is loaded with a mix of antioxidant-rich, non-fragrant plant oils and butters — think green tea seed, passionfruit, apricot, marula, and shea— to soothe and deeply moisturise dry, irritated skin. A helping of squalane, vitamin F, sodium hyaluronate and niacinamide then helps to encourage a stronger, healthier acid mantle, leaving your skin more equipped to defend against environmental stressors. A must for compromised skin, the lotion even boosts the production of vital natural moisturising factors — like ceramides and cholesterol — that keep skin soft and supple.","how_to_use":"Apply to clean, dry skin once per day. Those new to AHA exfoliation may want to start slowly, using T.L.C. Glycolic Body Lotion every other day for the first week of application.

May be mixed with Sili™ Body Lotion for a milder exfoliation experience. WARNING: Use only as directed. Avoid eye contact. Discontinue use immediately if irritation occurs and consult a physician.

Taking you on a sensory journey to Brazil (think: Rio’s Copacabana beach), this silky formula is fast-absorbing and packed with restorative ingredients for a gorgeous dewy finish. Let’s start with a fun fact about the hero ingredient: copaiba oil. It’s been used in Brazil for centuries as a natural healer after locals observed animals rubbing themselves against the trunk of the copaiba tree when wounded. This, alongside cold-pressed rosehip and buriti oils, makes Copa Dew a true wonder product (and multi-tasker!), brimming with nourishing antioxidants and vitamins to give your skin, hair and body the ultimate glow-up. In fact, you can even use it as a bath oil. The uplifting scent has been created with a blend of upcycled apple oil and notes of white tea, cedarwood and lemon peel. Dreamy doesn’t even cut it.","how_to_use":"Can be used on face, body and hair. For the face: apply a few drops to cleansed skin, taking some time to breath in the mood-lifting scent.

For the body: apply post-shower over damp skin and massage in circular motions for a boost of hydration and skin suppleness. Use on its own or mix a few drops with body lotion for extra nourishment. For the hair: apply to dry ends, brows and beard to lock in moisture, de-frizz and add major shine. Use as a pre-shampoo treatment overnight. For the bath: add a couple of drops into your bath and use as a nourishing bath oil. Bonus: Use as a cuticle oil for a longer-lasting mani, and wear as a light fragrance oil on your pulse points — breathe in and let the comforting fragrance boost positive emotions.","ingredient":"Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil (Grapeseed Oil), Squalane (Olive), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut Oil), Brassica Alba Seed Extract (Mustard Seed Oil), Parfum (Upcycled Apple Oil, Fragrance), Mauritia Flexuosa Fruit Oil (Buriti Oil), Rosa Canina Fruit Oil (Rosehip Oil), Copaifera Officinalis Resin (Copaiba Oil), Ribes Nigrum Seed Oil (Blackcurrant Seed Oil), Passiflora Edulis Seed Oil (Passion Fruit Oil), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Glycine Soja Oil (Soy), Limonene, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral (Fragrance).","brand":"Herlum","volume":"","image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/14323780-4805070888386025.jpg","num":999,"profit":28.862481043071433,"num_sell":0},

Budge-proof (even when rubbing skin with a towel!) and lasting twice as long as cream formulas, this marvel can also be used on scalps if you have thin hair - or even on parched hair itself to protect it from dehydrating.","how_to_use":"","ingredient":"Aqua, Butane, Propylene Glycol, Octocrylene, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Isobutane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Propane, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, PVP, Polysorbate 20, Triethanolamine, Carnosine, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycerin, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Dimethicone, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate","brand":"EVY Technology","volume":"","image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/13310480-8104896413489028.jpg","num":999,"profit":13.45531897254985,"num_sell":0},

Offering its services without a trace of chalkiness or white cast, this creamy and lightweight formula delivers a natural finish that looks neither too dewy nor too matte.

Broad-spectrum protection (that’s protection against UVA and UVB rays, FYI) joins an array of antioxidants in safeguarding you from blue light, and amino acid-rich sea fennel extract boosts your elastin levels to firm and add bounce. Plus, moringa seed extract boasts vitamin C and encourages the production of collagen, and aloe leaf extract attracts and retains moisture while soothing skin.","how_to_use":"HOW: Gently smooth an even, generous layer (about the size of a coin) onto skin. Because mineral SPF acts as a barrier, sitting on the surface of the skin, do smooth it on—don’t rub it in the way you would a moisturizer. Use a light touch with this and any products you apply after to avoid makeup pilling. WHERE: Face and neck. Bonus points for hands—after your eyes, hands are the number two spot that gives away age. WHEN: AM (every AM), after your moisturizer has fully absorbed into your skin. If wearing makeup, allow 2-3 minutes for the sunscreen to sink in before applying primer or other cosmetics. Reapply every 2 hours when in direct sunlight or getting wet. GOOD TO KNOW: Even though mineral sunscreen goes to work right away, we recommend following the FDA guidelines to wait 15 minutes before sun exposure. And remember: No sunscreen is a replacement for staying out of the sun.
