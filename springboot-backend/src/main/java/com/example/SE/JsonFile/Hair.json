Heating up faster than you can say 'I'm in love with my ghd's' (or thereabouts), this incredible tool takes only 25 seconds to be ready for use, making them a godsend for busy bees, rushed mornings and 'I should have arrived at the party half an hour ago' occasions. After extensive research, ghd's scientists concluded that 185ºC is the ideal temperature for styling; cooler temperatures deliver poorer styling results while hotter ones can cause irreversible, unnecessary hair damage. To ensure this optimum temperature is always maintained, the plates have been carefully crafted with dual-zone technology – instead of one, they have two heat sensors across each plate that regulate heat from root to tip. These clever floating plates are also ultra-smooth, gliding effortlessly through your tresses to create a frizz-free style with salon-rivalling shine. Great for straightening, curling or creating beachy waves, the tool has a round barrel to deliver snag-free, versatile styles with ease. For peace of mind, the device automatically switches off after 30 minutes and has a heat-resistant protective plate guard so you can take it out and about without risk of burns. With so much to offer, the golden ticket to your best hair yet is well deserved of a spot in your next Cult Beauty haul...","how_to_use":"Before use, spritz your hair generously with heat protectant.

Where possible, avoid wrapping it around the body of the Styler or hanging it by the cord as this could cause damage. The styler has a UK three-pin plug and is 68-75W.

From beautifully bright ‘The Big Pink’ to perfect pastels ‘Awkward Peach’ and ‘Blullini’, to brilliantly bold turquoise ‘Washed Up Mermaid’, there’s a shade to suit every aesthetic. Each shade has a different lifecycle - the more subtle 'Rosé' will fade in 1-3 washes, while the ultra-bright 'I Saw Red' lasts from 3-30 washes - so be sure to check before you invest; plus, the colour and fade will vary depending upon the tone and porosity of your hair. Sure to satisfy the wildest colour chameleons and indecisive individuals, get ready to explore your every shade craving. Like the entire BLEACH range, Super Cool Colour is completely cruelty-free and vegan – just another reason we love it. Want to get the best out of your new-found colour?

One bottle is suitable for short hair or colouring freshly bleached and toned roots. For shoulder-length hair you'll need two bottles. For long hair that's below your shoulders, you'll need three to four bottles. If your hair is very thick we recommend adding an extra bottle.","ingredient":"GOBBY PINK Aqua (Water), Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Quaternium-22, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Amodimethicone, Propylene Glycol, Silicone Quaternium-16, Butylene Glycol, Panthenol, Trideceth-12, Undeceth-5, Undeceth-11, Butyloctanol, Wheat Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Parfum (Fragrance), Linalool, Benzyl Salicylate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Triethylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Basic Violet 2, Basic Red 51, Acid Red 52, HC Blue No.16.

{"productId":"Hair_281","category":"Hair","name":"Living Proof No Frizz Instant De-Frizzer 95ml","cost":"£15.00","description":"Frizz-smoothing is a notoriously tricky business – most anti-frizz products rely on silicones to lubricate the hair’s surface and weigh strands down, which helps to minimise friction but ceases to be as effective when things get hot and humid. Frizz is the product of these two factors; when hair is exposed to humidity or dampness, the moisture is absorbed into the hair fibre, causing the cuticle to flare out – as the strands rub against one another, the increase in friction results in frizz, so a true solution must successfully tackle both of these issues. Living Proof took it upon themselves to devise the biggest and most innovative anti-frizz breakthrough; OFPMA – the proprietary technology in Living Proof’s No Frizz products – which coats each strand more evenly than silicones, so moisture is unable to penetrate the hair shaft. It also helps to smooth each strand’s texture, so friction is minimised and frizz is conquered. Also in the Instant De-Frizzer is a clever blend of oils which replicate the functions of those found naturally in the hair, plus conditioning agents to soften and seal the cuticle. The result? Sleek, smooth and frizz-free locks.","how_to_use":"For medium to thick hair, hold canister 6-10\" away and spray on dry hair in a sweeping motion. Smooth hair with hands or comb. For fine hair, focus on applying from mid-lengths to ends.

In turn, this makes brushing or combing through your hair a whole lot easier, leading to less damage and stress in the long run.","how_to_use":"Work the conditioner into wet hair. Rinse.

{"productId":"Hair_353","category":"Hair","name":"ghd Max Styler Straightener","cost":"£199.00","description":"Ideal for long, thick or curly tresses, the ghd max styler has all the mane-changing benefits of the cult-adored original styler but with larger 2 inch plates. These smooth floating plates have been designed with ghd’s advanced ceramic heat technology, allowing a consistent temperature of 185ºC to be maintained for optimal styling – cooler temperatures deliver poorer styling results while hotter ones can cause irreversible, unnecessary hair damage. The result? Smoother, healthier, frizz-free locks with salon-quality shine. The clever features don’t end there: a rounded barrel allows for effortless snag-free styling, particularly when creating curls, while a ultra-speedy 30 second heat up time makes it a godsend on rushed mornings. It takes safety very seriously indeed too with a travel-friendly heat resistant protective plate guard and (best of all) an automatic sleep mode that switches the device off after 30 minutes – welcome relief for those heart-wrenching ‘did I leave my straighteners on’ moments.","how_to_use":"Before use, spritz your hair generously with heat protectant. We recommend ghd heat protect spray. Once the Styler has heated, use it to straighten, curl or create waves. Leave the Styler to cool, then fold the cord in the same way as it arrived in the original packaging. Where possible, avoid wrapping it around the body of the Styler or hanging it by the cord as this could cause damage. The styler has a UK three-pin plug and is 68-75W.","ingredient":"","brand":"ghd","volume":"","image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/12854856-6354842027306900.jpg","num":999,"profit":140.72501787153672,"num_sell":0},
