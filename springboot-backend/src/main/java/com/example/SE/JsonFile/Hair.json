A root-to-tip nourishing elixir, this serum nourishes hair, clears product build-up from the scalp, softens hair, smooths cuticles, adds shine and protects hair from further breakage — all with a deliciously mindful scent that instils a sense of peace and calm.

It does this via green tea extract – an antioxidant-rich ingredient than protects hair colour from water, UV rays and free radical pollutants. A protein-based complex also strengthens the hair and builds its resistance to brushing and combing, while pro vitamin B5 imparts moisture, shine and silkiness to improve on manageability while limiting the damage caused by chemical treatments.","how_to_use":"Apply to wet hair and lather, gently kneading the scalp for 60 seconds. Rinse well and repeat if necessary. If colour treating your hair at home, use to wash out colour following application and for each wash following. If having hair colour treated or chemically processed in the salon, use from the first wash after having hair treated.","ingredient":"Aqua/Water/Eau, Disodium Laureth-9 Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Steareth-100/PEG-136/HDI Copolymer, Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Alaninate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Parfum (Fragrance), Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-53, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Phytic Acid, Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride, Butylene Glycol, Coumarin, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin.","brand":"Philip Kingsley","volume":"250ml","mark":0,"image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/12752630-2914871560225044.jpg"},

If you are a platinum blonde: To maintain tone, use Bust Your Brass Shampoo + Conditioner every other wash. We suggest alternating Bust Your Brass Shampoo + Conditioner with the Kure Shampoo + Conditioner and Multi-Task Repair Treatment. Use bust your brass repair mask 1x per week in place of conditioner. If you notice pesky brassiness pop up, use the Bust Your Brass system every wash until desired tone is reached. Keep track of your tone: if you're loving your tone, keep up your routine as is. If you notice brassiness peeking in, increase use of the Bust Your Brass mask an additional time per week. If you are a little too cool-toned and nearing a violet tone, cut back on the Bust Your Brass routine for a week or two. If you have highlights, a balayage, or natural-looking (colour-treated) blonde hair: Use bust your brass shampoo + conditioner every other wash. Assess hair's tone and pivot (increase or decrease usage) as needed. Those with naturally dark hair should use the bust your brass intense repair mask 1x per week in place of conditioner. Please note: naturally darker or brunette hair will fight to return to natural hair color; in this case, increase the usage of system. If you have grey hair: Use bust your brass shampoo + mask every wash or alternate every other wash with the kure collection. If you are a textured blonde: Follow the regimen suggested above based on the type of blonde, but use the Bust Your Brass Repair Mask in place of conditioner for an extra dose of moisture.

The texture is a unique powder to jelly, which – stay with us here – actually helps you to get the most out of your vitamin C. Allow us to explain… Vitamin C is an unstable molecule that oxidises on exposure to light, air and heat, which instantly reduces its efficacy, rendering it pointless. This is common in liquid formulas, which is why Philip Kingsley has made this pre-shampoo treatment in powder form – thus removing any instability and making the vitamin much more potent. Impurities on the scalp can accrue with exposure to city pollution, hard water and product build-up, leaving your hair limp and lacklustre. Vitamin C’s acidity helps to remove these impurities – deeply cleansing residue and restoring radiance. Being a strong antioxidant, it also protects your scalp from free radicals – neutralising them and aiding in skin’s natural healing process to allow later treatments to work more effectively. Also starring naturally derived amino acids and vitamin B5 (AKA panthenol) this sensational formula even provides lasting moisture, conditions, thickens and helps to prevent damage.","how_to_use":"Before shampooing, thoroughly wet the hair and scalp. Empty one sachet into the applicator bottle and fill with 60ml of warm water (to the measured mark). Shake for 30 seconds to activate the formula, until a light jelly forms. Apply the jelly directly from the bottle to the hair and scalp and work in with fingertips. Ensure all hair is covered. Use all of the jelly and dispose of any which is not used. Thoroughly rinse out the bottle and keep for your next treatment. Leave on for 5 minutes and then rinse thoroughly. Follow with shampoo and conditioner as normal. Use once every 2-3 weeks to remove all impurities. Do not use for the first 3 washes after having hair colour treated.","ingredient":"Panthenol, Ascorbic Acid, Betaine, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citronellol, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal.","brand":"Philip Kingsley","volume":"4 x 5g","mark":0,"image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/12919573-1314967696316375.jpg"},

Frizz is the product of these two factors; when hair is exposed to humidity or dampness, the moisture is absorbed into the hair fibre, causing the cuticle to flare out – as the strands rub against one another, the increase in friction results in frizz, so a true solution must successfully tackle both of these issues. Living Proof took it upon themselves to devise the biggest and most innovative anti-frizz breakthrough; OFPMA – the proprietary technology in Living Proof’s No Frizz products – which coats each strand more evenly than silicones, so moisture is unable to penetrate the hair shaft. It also helps to smooth each strand’s texture, so friction is minimised and frizz is conquered. Also in the Instant De-Frizzer is a clever blend of oils which replicate the functions of those found naturally in the hair, plus conditioning agents to soften and seal the cuticle. The result? Sleek, smooth and frizz-free locks.","how_to_use":"For medium to thick hair, hold canister 6-10\" away and spray on dry hair in a sweeping motion. Smooth hair with hands or comb.

In fact – when compared to a standard conditioner in a lab-controlled test – this formula prolonged colour by up to 100% longer, and it protects your colour for up to 24 washes! It does this via South American vegetable oil, which is rich in omega 9 and fatty acids to strengthen the structure and cuticle – restoring and softening compromised lengths.

A goldsend for busy bees who love a five-minutes-to-get-ready challenge, this incredible tool races the clock so you don’t have to. After extensive research, ghd's scientists concluded that 185ºC is the ideal temperature for styling; cooler temperatures deliver poorer styling results while hotter ones can cause irreversible, unnecessary hair damage. To ensure this optimum temperature is always maintained, the plates have been carefully crafted with dual-zone technology – instead of one, they have two heat sensors across each plate that regulate heat from root to tip. These clever floating plates are also ultra-smooth, gliding effortlessly through your tresses to create a frizz-free style with salon-rivalling shine. Great for straightening, curling or creating beachy waves, the tool has a round barrel to deliver snag-free, versatile styles with ease. For peace of mind, the device automatically switches off after 30 minutes and has a heat-resistant protective plate guard so you can take it out and about without risk of burns. With so much to offer, the golden ticket to your best hair yet is well deserved of a spot in your next Cult Beauty haul…","how_to_use":"Before use, spritz your hair generously with heat protectant. We recommend ghd heat protect spray. Once the Styler has heated, use it to straighten, curl or create waves. Leave the Styler to cool, then fold the cord in the same way as it arrived in the original packaging. Where possible, avoid wrapping it around the body of the Styler or hanging it by the cord as this could cause damage. The styler has a UK three-pin plug and is 68-75W.

It's infused with carob gum to lock in moisture, as well as a vegetable-derived polymer to enhance curl formation and definition. Rice protein and sunflower seed oil are responsible for protecting against the drying effects of UV rays, while water-soluble jojoba oil delivers a wave of shine-boosting hydration. What's not in the formula is just as impressive - it's made without parabens, silicones, sulphates and synthetic colourants, to name a few!","how_to_use":"Wet hair thoroughly, work a quarter-size amount of shampoo into palms, and emulsify with water, working into a latherbefore applying. Massage shampoo into hair and scalp to form a rich lather. Rinse and repeat if necessary.

With a 26mm barrel and spring-activated lever, it creates consistent medium-sized curls from root to tip. As with all of ghd's covetable range, the tong adheres to the brand's research-backed optimum temperature of 185ºC - cooler temperatures deliver poorer styling results while hotter ones can cause irreversible, unnecessary hair damage. This is regulated and maintained through clever ultra-zone technology, which recognises each section of hair and adapts the heat accordingly. Other clever features include a cool tip to safely hold your hair in place as you style, a ceramic coating to allow for smoother curling and a professional length swivel cable to grant flexibility and easy reach. It takes safety very seriously indeed too: there's a safety stand to secure it on a hard surface when you're not styling, and - perfect for the forgetful among us - an automatic sleep mode that turns the device off after 30 minutes. Beautiful curls and healthy hair? Two words: No brainer.","how_to_use":"Before use, spritz your hair generously with heat protectant. We recommend ghd heat protect spray. For long-lasting, classic curls, section your strands into approximately 2cm wide pieces, then open the clamp and flat wrap the hair around the barrel. Close the clamp to secure the end of the hair in place. Wait 5-8 seconds and then open the clamp to release. For soft, luxe waves, section your strands into approximately 2cm wide pieces, then twist wrap the hair around the barrel. Hold the hair in place for 5-8 seconds (the clamp may not close completely due to the twisted section of hair being thicker) and then release. When finished, leave the tong to cool then fold the cord in the same way as it arrived in the original packaging. Where possible, avoid wrapping it around the body of the tong or hanging it by the cord as this could cause damage. The tong has a UK three-pin plug. Packaging may vary.","ingredient":"","brand":"ghd","volume":"","mark":0,"image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/11058313-1795006344344912.jpg"},

Heating up faster than you can say 'I'm in love with my ghd's' (or thereabouts), this incredible tool takes only 25 seconds to be ready for use, making them a godsend for busy bees, rushed mornings and 'I should have arrived at the party half an hour ago' occasions. After extensive research, ghd's scientists concluded that 185ºC is the ideal temperature for styling; cooler temperatures deliver poorer styling results while hotter ones can cause irreversible, unnecessary hair damage. To ensure this optimum temperature is always maintained, the plates have been carefully crafted with dual-zone technology – instead of one, they have two heat sensors across each plate that regulate heat from root to tip. These clever floating plates are also ultra-smooth, gliding effortlessly through your tresses to create a frizz-free style with salon-rivalling shine. Great for straightening, curling or creating beachy waves, the tool has a round barrel to deliver snag-free, versatile styles with ease. For peace of mind, the device automatically switches off after 30 minutes and has a heat-resistant protective plate guard so you can take it out and about without risk of burns. With so much to offer, the golden ticket to your best hair yet is well deserved of a spot in your next Cult Beauty haul...","how_to_use":"Before use, spritz your hair generously with heat protectant.

{"productId":"Hair_964","category":"Hair","name":"ghd Mini Styler ghd Mini Styler","cost":"£149.00","description":"A hair styling hero for short hair and fringes, the ghd mini styler has all you loved about the original styler but with narrower ½ inch plates - it's worth noting that 'mini' only applies to the plates and the body length of the device remains the same. These slimline floating plates allow easier access to shorter strands, meaning they won't make your fringe 'stick out', and in combination with the slender rounded barrel they're also excellent for creating tight bouncy curls. In tandem with ghd's research-backed optimum styling temperature of 185ºC (cooler temperatures deliver poorer styling results while hotter ones can cause irreversible, unnecessary hair damage), the tool features advanced ceramic heat technology to ensure this temperature is evenly distributed across the plates - oh, and they heat up in just 30 seconds! Putting an end to those heart-wrenching 'did I leave my straighteners on' moments, these safety-conscious stylers automatically switch off after 30 minutes (phew!) - plus they have a heat-resistant protective plate guard so you can take these out and about without risk of burns. What's not to love?","how_to_use":"Before use, spritz your hair generously with heat protectant. We recommend ghd heat protect spray. Once the Styler has heated, use it to straighten, curl or create waves. Leave the Styler to cool, then fold the cord in the same way as it arrived in the original packaging. Where possible, avoid wrapping it around the body of the Styler or hanging it by the cord as this could cause damage. The styler has a UK three-pin plug and is 68-75W. Packaging may vary.","ingredient":"","brand":"ghd","volume":"","mark":0,"image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/small/original//productimg/1600/1600/11689413-9354824617645169.jpg"},

Other clever features include a cool tip to safely hold your hair in place as you style, a ceramic coating to allow for smoother curling and a professional length swivel cable to grant flexibility and easy reach. It takes safety very seriously indeed too: there's a safety stand to secure it on a hard surface when you're not styling, and - perfect for the forgetful among us - an automatic sleep mode that turns the device off after 30 minutes. Beautiful curls and healthy hair? Two words: No brainer.","how_to_use":"Before use, spritz your hair generously with heat protectant. We recommend ghd heat protect spray. For long-lasting, classic curls, section your strands into approximately 2cm wide pieces, then open the clamp and flat wrap the hair around the barrel. Close the clamp to secure the end of the hair in place. Wait 5-8 seconds and then open the clamp to release. For soft, luxe waves, section your strands into approximately 2cm wide pieces, then twist wrap the hair around the barrel. Hold the hair in place for 5-8 seconds (the clamp may not close completely due to the twisted section of hair being thicker) and then release. When finished, leave the tong to cool then fold the cord in the same way as it arrived in the original packaging. Where possible, avoid wrapping it around the body of the tong or hanging it by the cord as this could cause damage. The tong has a UK three-pin plug. Packaging may vary.","ingredient":"","brand":"ghd","volume":"","mark":0,"image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/11058313-1795006344344912.jpg"},

Once you've dried your mane (and all without a single sizzle or hint of damage), it's time to turn your tool into a classic styler.

The ghd creative curl tong is cleverly tapered from a round 28mm to an oval 23mm tip without a clamp to allow for a wide variety of long-lasting styles across all hair types and lengths - even shorter styles. As with all of ghd's heat styling tools, it maintains a research-backed optimum temperature of 185ºC; cooler temperatures deliver poorer styling results while hotter ones can cause irreversible, unnecessary hair damage. Ingenious ultra-zone technology upholds this across the entire barrel throughout styling by recognising each section of hair and adapting the heat accordingly. There's no clamp to secure tips in place, but instead there's a ghd styling glove included and a protective cool tip to hold strands in place while you're styling, not to mention a safety stand for resting the wand on a hard surface.

For natural-looking curls, section your strands into approximately 2cm wide pieces, then open the clamp and flat wrap the hair around the barrel. Close the clamp to secure the end of the hair in place. Wait 5-8 seconds and then open the clamp to release. For beachy, loose waves, section your strands into approximately 2cm wide pieces, then twist wrap the hair around the barrel. Hold the hair in place for 5-8 seconds (the clamp may not close completely due to the twisted section of hair being thicker) and then release. When finished, leave the tong to cool then fold the cord in the same way as it arrived in the original packaging. Where possible, avoid wrapping it around the body of the tong or hanging it by the cord as this could cause damage. The tong has a UK three-pin plug.

The ghd creative curl tong is cleverly tapered from a round 28mm to an oval 23mm tip without a clamp to allow for a wide variety of long-lasting styles across all hair types and lengths - even shorter styles. As with all of ghd's heat styling tools, it maintains a research-backed optimum temperature of 185ºC; cooler temperatures deliver poorer styling results while hotter ones can cause irreversible, unnecessary hair damage. Ingenious ultra-zone technology upholds this across the entire barrel throughout styling by recognising each section of hair and adapting the heat accordingly.

For natural-looking curls, section your strands into approximately 2cm wide pieces, then open the clamp and flat wrap the hair around the barrel.

For beachy, loose waves, section your strands into approximately 2cm wide pieces, then twist wrap the hair around the barrel. Hold the hair in place for 5-8 seconds (the clamp may not close completely due to the twisted section of hair being thicker) and then release. When finished, leave the tong to cool then fold the cord in the same way as it arrived in the original packaging. Where possible, avoid wrapping it around the body of the tong or hanging it by the cord as this could cause damage. The tong has a UK three-pin plug.

Best used in conjunction with the Healthy Scalp Serum, this gently – but thoroughly – stimulates growth by awakening follicles to support the hair growth cycle. Waging two-pronged attack on the first signs of thinning and hair loss (whether due to stress, over-styling or postpartum) – as well as persistent scalp itchiness, the needles create ‘micro channels’ for serum to penetrate deeply (and get to the root of the issue). Helping to protect your precious follicles by gradually firming the scalp’s upper layers (these naturally thin as we age), it takes just 60 seconds every day to see a noticeable difference in the strength and health of hair – not to mention an improvement when it comes to widened partings, thinning edges and the damage wrought by too-tight ponytails or overstyling.","how_to_use":"Use GloPRO® SCALP on clean, product-free hair. Hair may be damp or dry. Part hair into sections, lightly hold hair taut and in parallel with hair strands, gently glide GloPRO® back and forth over the scalp for about 5 seconds per target area. Continue parting hair and using GloPRO® until all desired areas have been treated. For optimal results, immediately apply the Healthy Scalp Serum (sold separately) or hair-enhancing topicals to scalp. Warning: Do not roll GloPRO® SCALP attachment through loose hair. Do not use the SCALP Attachment on the face, lips, eyelid, eye area or body.
