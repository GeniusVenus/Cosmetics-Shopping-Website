Over time, strands become brittle, dry and more susceptible to breakage – which is why we often reach for short-term synthetic cover-ups, which only exacerbate the problem. Oils and silicones are effective ‘quick fixes’ but only temporarily disguise the underlying damage – which is why Living Proof have developed a targeted range of reparative products, to fortify strands from the inside out. Their innovative silicone and oil-free solutions star the brand’s patented OFPMA – the proprietary technology that coats each individual hair with an ultra-thin, non-greasy shield that smooths, corrects and protects from root-to-tip, whilst re-establishing moisture balance and delivering UV and thermal protection up to 235°C. With regular use, hair is proven to become up to 20 x more resistant to split ends, as well as more glossy, lustrous and reassuringly envy-inducing.","how_to_use":"Start with Restore Shampoo.

Here to bring the best out of lighter-toned tresses, amika’s Bust Your Brass Cool Blonde Repair Shampoo unites innovative ‘Bond Cure Technology’ to keep breakage at bay, with corrective pigments to leave your hair strong and colour on point. Working alongside your normal hair wash days, this ultra-violet hued shampoo counteracts unwanted brassy and yellow tones to keep blondes, silvers or greys as intended.

If you are a platinum blonde: To maintain tone, use Bust Your Brass Shampoo + Conditioner every other wash. We suggest alternating Bust Your Brass Shampoo + Conditioner with the Kure Shampoo + Conditioner and Multi-Task Repair Treatment. Use bust your brass repair mask 1x per week in place of conditioner. If you notice pesky brassiness pop up, use the Bust Your Brass system every wash until desired tone is reached. Keep track of your tone: if you're loving your tone, keep up your routine as is. If you notice brassiness peeking in, increase use of the Bust Your Brass mask an additional time per week. If you are a little too cool-toned and nearing a violet tone, cut back on the Bust Your Brass routine for a week or two. If you have highlights, a balayage, or natural-looking (colour-treated) blonde hair: Use bust your brass shampoo + conditioner every other wash. Assess hair's tone and pivot (increase or decrease usage) as needed. Those with naturally dark hair should use the bust your brass intense repair mask 1x per week in place of conditioner. Please note: naturally darker or brunette hair will fight to return to natural hair color; in this case, increase the usage of system. If you have grey hair: Use bust your brass shampoo + mask every wash or alternate every other wash with the kure collection. If you are a textured blonde: Follow the regimen suggested above based on the type of blonde, but use the Bust Your Brass Repair Mask in place of conditioner for an extra dose of moisture. The bust your brass repair mask is the perfect mix of toning, moisture, and repair which is just what a textured blonde needs.","ingredient":"Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Glyceryl Stearate, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn/Argousier) Fruit/Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage/Bourrache) Seed Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado/Avocat) Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango/Mangue) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea/Karite) Butter, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender/Lavande) Flower Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria/Matricaire) Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary/Romarin) Leaf Extract, Hydrolyzed Quinoa, Aminomethyl Propanol, Bis-Pca Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Disodium Peg-12 Dimethicone Sulfosuccinate, Peg-55 Propylene Glycol Oleate, Peg-12 Dimethicone, Peg-150 Distearate, Peg-150 Stearate, Polyquaternium-10, Polyquaternium-7, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Polyethylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Sodium Chloride, Fragrance/Parfum, Benzyl Benzoate, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Ext.

The texture is a unique powder to jelly, which – stay with us here – actually helps you to get the most out of your vitamin C. Allow us to explain… Vitamin C is an unstable molecule that oxidises on exposure to light, air and heat, which instantly reduces its efficacy, rendering it pointless. This is common in liquid formulas, which is why Philip Kingsley has made this pre-shampoo treatment in powder form – thus removing any instability and making the vitamin much more potent. Impurities on the scalp can accrue with exposure to city pollution, hard water and product build-up, leaving your hair limp and lacklustre. Vitamin C’s acidity helps to remove these impurities – deeply cleansing residue and restoring radiance. Being a strong antioxidant, it also protects your scalp from free radicals – neutralising them and aiding in skin’s natural healing process to allow later treatments to work more effectively. Also starring naturally derived amino acids and vitamin B5 (AKA panthenol) this sensational formula even provides lasting moisture, conditions, thickens and helps to prevent damage.","how_to_use":"Before shampooing, thoroughly wet the hair and scalp. Empty one sachet into the applicator bottle and fill with 60ml of warm water (to the measured mark). Shake for 30 seconds to activate the formula, until a light jelly forms. Apply the jelly directly from the bottle to the hair and scalp and work in with fingertips. Ensure all hair is covered. Use all of the jelly and dispose of any which is not used. Thoroughly rinse out the bottle and keep for your next treatment. Leave on for 5 minutes and then rinse thoroughly. Follow with shampoo and conditioner as normal. Use once every 2-3 weeks to remove all impurities. Do not use for the first 3 washes after having hair colour treated.","ingredient":"Panthenol, Ascorbic Acid, Betaine, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citronellol, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal.","brand":"Philip Kingsley","volume":"4 x 5g","mark":0,"image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/12919573-1314967696316375.jpg"},
