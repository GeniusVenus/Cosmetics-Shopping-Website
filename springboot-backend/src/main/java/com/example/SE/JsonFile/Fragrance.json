In just 30 minutes, this rich, luscious mask can reveal a rainbow of bold, chic shades. From beautifully bright ‘The Big Pink’ to perfect pastels ‘Awkward Peach’ and ‘Blullini’, to brilliantly bold turquoise ‘Washed Up Mermaid’, there’s a shade to suit every aesthetic. Each shade has a different lifecycle - the more subtle 'Rosé' will fade in 1-3 washes, while the ultra-bright 'I Saw Red' lasts from 3-30 washes - so be sure to check before you invest; plus, the colour and fade will vary depending upon the tone and porosity of your hair. Sure to satisfy the wildest colour chameleons and indecisive individuals, get ready to explore your every shade craving. Like the entire BLEACH range, Super Cool Colour is completely cruelty-free and vegan – just another reason we love it. Want to get the best out of your new-found colour? Stock up on the corresponding toning shampoo and conditioner to maintain vibrancy!","how_to_use":"Wearing gloves, apply generously to shampooed, towel dried hair. Massage or comb through mid-lengths and ends to ensure you cover all the hair evenly, leave to develop for 30 minutes. Rinse out with lukewarm water and style as desired. For best results apply on very light blonde, bleached hair. Colour may vary depending on existing tone and porosity of hair. One bottle is suitable for short hair or colouring freshly bleached and toned roots. For shoulder-length hair you'll need two bottles. For long hair that's below your shoulders, you'll need three to four bottles. If your hair is very thick we recommend adding an extra bottle.","ingredient":"GOBBY PINK Aqua (Water), Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Quaternium-22, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Amodimethicone, Propylene Glycol, Silicone Quaternium-16, Butylene Glycol, Panthenol, Trideceth-12, Undeceth-5, Undeceth-11, Butyloctanol, Wheat Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Parfum (Fragrance), Linalool, Benzyl Salicylate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Triethylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Basic Violet 2, Basic Red 51, Acid Red 52, HC Blue No.16.

{"productId":"Fragrance_281","category":"Fragrance","name":"Living Proof No Frizz Instant De-Frizzer 95ml","cost":"£15.00","description":"Frizz-smoothing is a notoriously tricky business – most anti-frizz products rely on silicones to lubricate the hair’s surface and weigh strands down, which helps to minimise friction but ceases to be as effective when things get hot and humid. Frizz is the product of these two factors; when hair is exposed to humidity or dampness, the moisture is absorbed into the hair fibre, causing the cuticle to flare out – as the strands rub against one another, the increase in friction results in frizz, so a true solution must successfully tackle both of these issues. Living Proof took it upon themselves to devise the biggest and most innovative anti-frizz breakthrough; OFPMA – the proprietary technology in Living Proof’s No Frizz products – which coats each strand more evenly than silicones, so moisture is unable to penetrate the hair shaft. It also helps to smooth each strand’s texture, so friction is minimised and frizz is conquered. Also in the Instant De-Frizzer is a clever blend of oils which replicate the functions of those found naturally in the hair, plus conditioning agents to soften and seal the cuticle. The result? Sleek, smooth and frizz-free locks.","how_to_use":"For medium to thick hair, hold canister 6-10\" away and spray on dry hair in a sweeping motion. Smooth hair with hands or comb.
