Neutralising yellow, orangey pigments, this semi-permanent (it lasts around 16-20 washes) post-bleach toner kit keeps hair at its brightest blonde, whether you’re golden, white, silver or platinum. Containing a tube of colourant, a bottle of developer lotion (peroxide) and a repairing treatment mask (to nourish stressed-out strands), alongside a pair of plastic gloves and an instruction leaflet, this really does contain everything you need to carry off effortless application. As if all that wasn’t enough, the collection is completely cruelty-free and vegan – like all of BLEACH’s products – so you can feel caring as well as cool.","how_to_use":"Instructions included in box. This semi-permanent dye will last for around 16-20 washes. The colour achieved and the length of its duration can be influenced by many factors including: Condition of hair, previous treatments, hair colour, porosity, length and fineness of hair. The final effect will depend on your hair colour. Best results will be seen on already very pale yellow bleached or highlighted hair. If your hair isn’t already blonde, use BLEACH London TOTAL BLEACH or BLEACH London DIY DIP DYE to lighten your hair first. You may need more than one pack if your hair is long, thick or hasn’t been dyed before. It’s always a good idea to have another pack to hand just in case one runs out before you’re finished colouring. Follow with BLEACH London SILVER SHAMPOO every other wash to extend brightness.","ingredient":"Colourant 40ml :- Aqua (Water), Cetearyl Alcohol, Cocamide MEA, Polysilicone-18 Cetyl Phosphate, Ethanolamine, Carbomer, Sodium Sulfite, Betaine, Dipropylene Glycol, PEG-40 Castor Oil, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Mica, CI 77891/Titanium Dioxide, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Bisabolol, Sodium Chloride, Trisodium HEDTA, Boswellia Serrata Gum, Toluene-2,5-Diamine Sulfate, Resorcinol, Sodium Benzoate, 2-Amino-4-Hydroxyethylaminoanisole Sulfate, 4-Amino-m-Cresol, 4-Amino-2-Hydroxytoluene.

From beautifully bright ‘The Big Pink’ to perfect pastels ‘Awkward Peach’ and ‘Blullini’, to brilliantly bold turquoise ‘Washed Up Mermaid’, there’s a shade to suit every aesthetic. Each shade has a different lifecycle - the more subtle 'Rosé' will fade in 1-3 washes, while the ultra-bright 'I Saw Red' lasts from 3-30 washes - so be sure to check before you invest; plus, the colour and fade will vary depending upon the tone and porosity of your hair. Sure to satisfy the wildest colour chameleons and indecisive individuals, get ready to explore your every shade craving. Like the entire BLEACH range, Super Cool Colour is completely cruelty-free and vegan – just another reason we love it. Want to get the best out of your new-found colour?

One bottle is suitable for short hair or colouring freshly bleached and toned roots. For shoulder-length hair you'll need two bottles. For long hair that's below your shoulders, you'll need three to four bottles.

Frizz is the product of these two factors; when hair is exposed to humidity or dampness, the moisture is absorbed into the hair fibre, causing the cuticle to flare out – as the strands rub against one another, the increase in friction results in frizz, so a true solution must successfully tackle both of these issues. Living Proof took it upon themselves to devise the biggest and most innovative anti-frizz breakthrough; OFPMA – the proprietary technology in Living Proof’s No Frizz products – which coats each strand more evenly than silicones, so moisture is unable to penetrate the hair shaft. It also helps to smooth each strand’s texture, so friction is minimised and frizz is conquered. Also in the Instant De-Frizzer is a clever blend of oils which replicate the functions of those found naturally in the hair, plus conditioning agents to soften and seal the cuticle. The result? Sleek, smooth and frizz-free locks.","how_to_use":"For medium to thick hair, hold canister 6-10\" away and spray on dry hair in a sweeping motion. Smooth hair with hands or comb.

With a 26mm barrel and spring-activated lever, it creates consistent medium-sized curls from root to tip. As with all of ghd's covetable range, the tong adheres to the brand's research-backed optimum temperature of 185ºC - cooler temperatures deliver poorer styling results while hotter ones can cause irreversible, unnecessary hair damage. This is regulated and maintained through clever ultra-zone technology, which recognises each section of hair and adapts the heat accordingly. Other clever features include a cool tip to safely hold your hair in place as you style, a ceramic coating to allow for smoother curling and a professional length swivel cable to grant flexibility and easy reach. It takes safety very seriously indeed too: there's a safety stand to secure it on a hard surface when you're not styling, and - perfect for the forgetful among us - an automatic sleep mode that turns the device off after 30 minutes.

For soft, luxe waves, section your strands into approximately 2cm wide pieces, then twist wrap the hair around the barrel. Hold the hair in place for 5-8 seconds (the clamp may not close completely due to the twisted section of hair being thicker) and then release. When finished, leave the tong to cool then fold the cord in the same way as it arrived in the original packaging. Where possible, avoid wrapping it around the body of the tong or hanging it by the cord as this could cause damage. The tong has a UK three-pin plug.
