On clean brows, brush a small amount of wax through the brow. Use upward motions and continuously brush through the brow in desired direction. Starting from front to back, use the flat spatula to press brow hairs down flat. Sculpt into place until desired shape and lift is achieved.

Clean the applicator regularly with brush cleanser; warm water removes Brow Freeze from spoolie easily and quickly.","ingredient":"","brand":"Anastasia Beverly Hills","volume":"6g","image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/12878449-2024982450942373.jpg","num":999,"profit":13.667211260605185,"num_sell":0},

Now with new shades to choose from, the advanced, oil-free formula provides a translucent veil of colour and gives a radiant, luminous finish in a spectrum of 16 versatile shades. Offering advanced sun protection, it shields your skin from the suns harmful rays, while also reducing the appearance of hyperpigmentation and dark spots in as little as four weeks. Infused with lush, naturally derived botanicals, it helps skin to feel hydrated and encourages a bright, natural-looking glow; kopara from French Polynesia and mineral-rich sea water revive and remineralise skin for a softer, smoother finish. Its dermatologically tested, non-comodogenic and synthetic fragrance-free perfect!","how_to_use":"For subtle coverage, use the tinted moisturizer in place of foundation. Blend it along cheekbones, then swipe a bit down the nose and along the top of the forehead. This will even tone while keeping things light and sheer. For an extra glow, blend a pea-size amount with equal amount of Copacabana Illuminator and smooth over entire face.","ingredient":"Gotland: Active Octinoxate 7.4%, Titanium Dioxide 6.1% Inactive

From daytime understatement to smouldering, after-dark drama, the only limit is your own imagination - so unleash your inner sex kitten, or channel your dormant Park Avenue Princess - then go forth and ignite some passions. The shades in each palette are categorised as 'prime', 'enhance', 'smoke' and 'pop', and should be applied in that order to take you seamlessly from 'desk to dusk to disco!'.","how_to_use":"Desk (day look) Step 1: Using the eye blender brush, apply prime to the entire eye-lid, with a backwards and forwards 'windscreen wiper' motion. Then using the eye smudger brush apply the prime shade to the inner corners of the eyes to open them up. Step 2: Nestle the enhance shade in the outer corner of the eye socket using the eye smudger brush and blend. Then using the eye smudger brush apply the enhance shade along the upper and lower lashline. Dusk (evening look) Repeat steps 1 and 2. Step 3: using an eye smudger brush, blend the smoke shade from the outer corner of the eye, upwards and into the socket. Then using the same brush, apply the smoke shade along the upper lashline and into the socket in a half-moon shape. Also run it along the lower lashline. Disco (night look) Repeat steps 1, 2 and 3. Step 4: with your ring finger, apply the pop shade to the centre of your eyelid for amped up glamour.","ingredient":"Talc, Mica, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Octyldodecyl Stearoyl Stearate, Dimethicone, Zinc Stearate, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, Diisostearyl Malate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Silica, Hydrogenated Castor Oil Hydroxystearate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Potassium Sorbate, Chlorphenesin, Polyethylene, Isononyl Isononanoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Tin Oxide, Caprylyl Methicone, Tetrasodium EDTA, Zeolite, Dimethiconol, Sorbic Acid, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben, BHT, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, [May Contain: Ultramarines CI 77007, Carmine CI 75470, Ferric Ammonium Ferrocyanide CI 77510, Ferric Ferrocyanide CI 77510, Blue 1 Lake CI 42090, Titanium Dioxide CI 77891, Manganese Violet CI 77742, Iron Oxides CI 77492, Iron Oxides CI 77499, Iron Oxides CI 77491]","brand":"Charlotte Tilbury","volume":"","image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/13313618-4234896615822840.jpg","num":999,"profit":33.978060745850854,"num_sell":0},

Pick up metallics and cream shimmer marbles with a brush in small, circular motions then apply on lids for an illuminating finish. Build an extra layer using your fingers or a sponge brush for a high-shine foil effect. For a soft, pearlescent glow, apply the pearl gloss hybrid to bare lids using your finger or a flat brush. Huda’s tips: For deeper shades: blend is your friend! Brushes are super important to get a smooth finish in the crease and across the lid. Not all deep shades have to be bold and graphic; blend out the deep mattes with a fluffy brush to five definition and shape to the eyes for amore low key look. For soft daytime looks, build a light base using matte shades, adding shimmer across the lid using your finger, a flat brush or a sponge applicator. Don’t forget your lower lashline! The metallics and pearl gloss hybrid can also be used to contour the lower lashline or add to inner corners for a soft highlight that opens up the eyes.","ingredient":"Filthy, Hypnotic, Untamed, Rough, Spicy, Arouse, Naughty, Juicy: Talc, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Zea Mays Starch, Silica, Magnesiummyristate, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate,Dimethicone, Decylene Glycol, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer.
