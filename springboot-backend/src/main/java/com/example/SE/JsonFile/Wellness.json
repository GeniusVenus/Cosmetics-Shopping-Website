It doesn't end there... A herb that's used in traditional Chinese medicine, fo-ti is thought to increase circulation and encourage healthy hair growth; folic acid is thought to help the tissue in our hair, skin and nails grow smoothly and cells function properly when consumed regularly; an antioxidant known as PABA is employed to help to support the vibrancy of your natural hair colour and ward off grey by improving your body's ability to break down and efficiently utilise protein and use it more efficiently.","how_to_use":"Take two gummies a day at any time with food or no food.

The makers have cleverly combined Eastern wisdom with Scandinavian modernity to create a funky-looking acupressure mat that alleviates tension, stress and stubborn twinges - helping you to unwind, clear your mind and to feel more nimble. More than 8,800 non-toxic plastic spikes are arranged on the mat and work in a similar way to acupuncture needles, helping release endorphins (the body's own 'happiness' drug) and oyxtocin, to help you stay calm and relaxed.","how_to_use":"Lay the Bed of Nails on the floor or on a mattress and slowly lower yourself onto it. Beginners should wear a light T-shirt or lay a sheet over the mat until your body and skin get used to the spikes. Initially lie on the Bed of Nails for 10 - 15 mins, and as you get used to the pressure you can build up to 20 - 30 mins. Use as often as you need - preferably daily. Don't be alarmed if your skin stings a bit or feels warm and tingly, and it's perfectly safe to fall asleep for a while on the mat. Leaning against it (rather than laying on top of the mat and pillow) is a lighter way to use Bed of Nails while you acclimatise (you put less weight on the spikes when you do). Place the mat/pillow at the back of your sofa, bed or armchair to experience the benefits while building up your tolerance.","ingredient":"The nails are made of 100% recycled non-toxic ABS plastic, the textile is cotton.

They're also made with soft biodegradable bamboo, so you can wipe without worry!","how_to_use":"The vulva has its own microflora and microclimate from the rest of female intimate anatomy. The vulva is often mistakenly referred to as 'vagina,' even by big companies who claim to be experts on intimate wellness. This lack of understanding of the female anatomy impacts how they formulate intimate wellness products. To fix this, and with a decade of creating high-quality products for very precise use on intimate parts, Smile Makers has developed intimate wipes specifically for the vulva. Tip #1: use a wipe to refresh the vulva, the external part of the genitalia, before sex. Tip #2: use post-sex for an easy clean up. Tip #3: on the go, when you want to clean up and need a quick and/or eco-friendly way to do it. Tip #4: never use it internally in the vagina. The vagina is a self-cleaning organ with a delicate pH balance. Disrupting it can cause yeast infections.","ingredient":"Extracts Of Chamomilla Flower, Organic Aloe Vera, Vitamin E.

Made from fresh cow’s milk and farmed in France, lactoferrin is a natural, biologically active, iron-binding glycoprotein made up of a whopping 691 amino acids. A key protein found within your body, it’s already in your saliva, tears, white blood cells and sweat, and boasts antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory and skin-healing benefits. L-glutamine on the other hand, is the most commonly-found amino acid in your body – it’s needed for immune support and the production of glycogen and muscle tissue. It even fuels your intestinal cells, which makes it a key support for the digestive system. Together, these two ingredients work to regulate and reduce inflammation while encouraging cell regeneration, which helps to calm blemish-prone complexions and support skin repair – working to smooth the look of post-blemish scarring. They also support the gut microbiome – encouraging healthy gut flora to improve gut conditions, your skin health and your immune system.

Let us introduce you to theirvagina-friendly, Organic Cotton Tampons. Did you know that the majority of tampons are made out of synthetic materials and fibres which can cause vaginal discomfort? On top of that, these fibres can shed inside of the vagina and cause additional irritation.Studies also show that 15% of womens OB/GYN visits are due to irritation caused by menstruation care products, as most conventional tampons on the market are made from synthetic rayon fibres.DeoDocs 100% Organic Cotton Tampons are made without viscose/rayon and non-chlorine bleached cotton, are unscented, FDA-approved and clinically tested to be non-irritating and hypoallergenic. They've even added a special outer layer (also 100% cotton) to prevent shedding and fibre residues from remaining inside of the body once the tampon is removed.But it doesn't stop there, they're also made from 100% biodegradable materials (with a card board applicator) and are 100% vegan.","how_to_use":"Each box contains 16 tampons with cardboard applicators. Wash your hands and get into a comfortable position. You can squat, put one leg up, or sit on the toilet with your knees apart. Push the tampon into your vagina using the applicator or your finger. Inserting a tampon in your vagina is more comfortable if youre relaxed. Throw the wrapper and applicator in the bin dont flush them. Its best to change your tampon every 4-8 hours. Dont leave your tampon in for more than 8 hours. You can wear a tampon overnight, but put it in right before bed and change it as soon as you get up in the morning. You take the tampon out by gently pulling the string. Wrap used tampons in toilet paper and throw them away in the bin dont flush them.","ingredient":"100 % organic cotton","brand":"DeoDoc","volume":"","mark":0,"image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/13317008-1114952896481085.jpg","num":999},
