The makers have cleverly combined Eastern wisdom with Scandinavian modernity to create a funky-looking acupressure mat that alleviates tension, stress and stubborn twinges - helping you to unwind, clear your mind and to feel more nimble. More than 8,800 non-toxic plastic spikes are arranged on the mat and work in a similar way to acupuncture needles, helping release endorphins (the body's own 'happiness' drug) and oyxtocin, to help you stay calm and relaxed.","how_to_use":"Lay the Bed of Nails on the floor or on a mattress and slowly lower yourself onto it. Beginners should wear a light T-shirt or lay a sheet over the mat until your body and skin get used to the spikes. Initially lie on the Bed of Nails for 10 - 15 mins, and as you get used to the pressure you can build up to 20 - 30 mins. Use as often as you need - preferably daily. Don't be alarmed if your skin stings a bit or feels warm and tingly, and it's perfectly safe to fall asleep for a while on the mat. Leaning against it (rather than laying on top of the mat and pillow) is a lighter way to use Bed of Nails while you acclimatise (you put less weight on the spikes when you do). Place the mat/pillow at the back of your sofa, bed or armchair to experience the benefits while building up your tolerance.","ingredient":"The nails are made of 100% recycled non-toxic ABS plastic, the textile is cotton.

Designed to strengthen these muscles, the trainer can help to improve bladder control and sex, as well as preparing for childbirth and speeding up postnatal recovery. How does it work? The bulb of the tracker features force and motion sensors to measure the movement of your muscles as they contract and release. This is inserted into the vagina with the tail remaining outside and facing forwards (a little like a tampon), then via Bluetooth it connects to an app on your phone that will guide you through a series of five-minute workouts - from target hitting to strength exercises. There are four different levels to try - Training, Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced - all of which have been carefully designed with the help of physiotherapists and experts. The app also allows you to track your progress, set yourself targets and schedule reminders - plus it's fun, so it'll help you to stay motivated! Incredibly discreet, the device comes in a sleek carry case that doubles up as a charger so you can pop it in your on-the-go bag for use anytime, anywhere. 100% waterproof, the trainer is made with medical grade silicone making it incredibly durable and safe.","how_to_use":"Elvie Trainer is easy to insert: place the bulb inside like a tampon with the tail remaining outside, facing forward. Be sure to fully insert the bulb, but don't push it too high up. You can use water-based lubricant if you wish. We recommend you use the trainer either standing or lying, legs apart. If you find Elvie Trainer is slipping out or moving about inside, please try using Elvie Trainer with the optional cover. We recommend all women use Elvie Trainer both with and without at first to decide which provides the most comfortable fit for them. Also try changing position - if Elvie Trainer is slipping out, you might want to try lying for a workout, and see if you notice a difference. As with all exercise we encourage women to set realistic goals, so we recommend using Elvie Trainer three times a week as a minimum. However, if you want to use Elvie Trainer even more then that's even better! Made from a very hygienic and durable material, it can be cleaned using warm soapy water. During normal use it will only need charging about once a month and can be stored in the portable carry case between uses. You can use Elvie during pregnancy as long as you are not experiencing from any complications. Every pregnancy is unique so if you are unsure please consult your qualified medical professional before use. You can use Elvie Trainer after your qualified medical professional has advised that you are ready to resume to normal activities at your postpartum checkup, this is usually around 6 weeks after giving birth. Elvie Trainer is safe to use if you have a coil or IUD fitted.","ingredient":"Medical Grade Silicone","brand":"Elvie","volume":"","mark":0,"image":"https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/11513404-8924871771176260.jpg"},

Proven to protect this precious padding and to lessen pain in 90 days, Joints marries calcium, glucosamine and clinically studied Indian frankincense – a ‘Holy Trinity’ that helps to control inflammatory responses in the body while aiding mobility to keep joints strong and healthy, now and in the future.
